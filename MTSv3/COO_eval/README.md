`gt_val.zip` and `gt_test.zip` contain the points (coordinates) of each polygon without word gt. <br>
To focus on the detection task, all polygons have "dummy" instead of word gt. <br>
For example,
```
1041,62,1121,51,1135,154,1091,221,1073,212,1075,183,1065,183,1032,143,dummy
926,877,963,879,1083,919,1068,955,1054,945,1039,945,962,932,929,930,911,923,dummy
382,982,430,982,430,1095,382,1095,dummy
```
